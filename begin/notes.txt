niche wala apply hoga
butttt , specificity winss!!
ex : 
for 2 p tags in which one has class called gray
then if
.gray{
    color: red
}
.
.
.
p{
    color: blue
}

the p tag with class gray will have red color onlyy!!!!


font size:
the rem unit is only relative to the document's 
root element, while the em unit is only relative 
to the immediate parent of the targeted element

we can use em for padding and column crreations etc
